--- WHAT IS IT?
*************************************************************************************************************

GLPI is the Information Resource-Manager with an additional Administration-
Interface. You can use it to build up a database with an inventory for your 
company (computer, software, printers...). It has enhanced functions to make the daily life for the 
administrators easier, like a job-tracking-system with mail-notification and 
methods to build a database with basic information about your network-topology.

The principal functionalities of the application are : 

1) the precise inventory of all the technical resources. All their characteristics will be stored in a database. 

2) management and the history of the maintenance actions and the bound procedures. 
This application is dynamic and is directly connected to the users who can post requests to the technicians.
An interface thus authorizes the latter with if required preventing the service of maintenance 
and indexing a problem encountered with one of the technical resources to which they have access.


*************************************************************************************************************
--- REQUIREMENTS (only tested with this setup, try it on your own)
*************************************************************************************************************

1) Apache 1.3.>6 with PHP 4 (PHP3 doesn't work anymore)
2) MySQL 4.1.13 and +
3) Javascript activate


*************************************************************************************************************
--- UPDATE
*************************************************************************************************************

I) Save your configuration :

First of all you must do 2 things :

1 - Save your database using the GLPI interface. 
2 - Save all the glpi directory containing your SQL backup and your documents (GLPI >= 0.5)


Now, if the update is going wrong or that you do not appreciate new version, 
it is easy to return to your preceding version.

Nevertheless, if this first step proceeded badly,  thanks for forwarding to us as fast as possible 
the procedure used and the error message which you obtain (on the mailing lists, or the forum of 
the site of the project, or on the bugtrack). 

II) Get and install the files


1) Download the last tarball on the download ("Télécharger" in french) section of the website 
of the GLPI project (http://glpi-project.org).

Case : you pass to a GLPI >= 0.68 :
Backup all your GLPI directory and delete it.
Some directories have changed. You must to copy files :
/backup/dump -> /files/_dumps
/docs/ -> /files

2) Uncompress the GLPI tarball where the previous one was.

3) Delete the file [your_http_root/]/config/config_db.php

4) Change acces rights to the following directory (add write access) :

-[your_http_root/]/glpi/config/
-[your_http_root/]/glpi/files

in order that PHP can write in them.

III)Launch the update :

1) Use your favorite browser to get the address http://yourserver/glpi/

2) Select your favorite langage and click on « ok ».

3) Click on  « update ».

4) Verify that firsts checks succeed. If not follow the comments and retry.

If all checks are ok click on « continue ».

5) Configure the access to your Mysql server. You can found these informations in the backup of your config.php.
Mysql server : mysql hostname
Mysql user : mysql username
Mysql pass : mysql password of the mysql username

Then, click on « continue »

6) Select the database you want to update.
You can find hos name in the backup of your config.php file ($dbdefault variable).
Click on « continue »

7) You must confirm the update of the choosen database. Click on « continue » if it is right.

8) The update begin. The time of the update depend of your database size, so it must be quite long.

#### VERSION < 0.4
ATTENTION : The update do not keep your previous configurations whoch are store in the config.php file 
(general configuration, external auth, mailing, etc)

You must to use the post-install configuration forms in the "configuration" section of GLPI to setup them again.
###########

9) There is a major difference in the versions < with 0.5 and the 0.5 one: the management of the locations. 
Indeed, it is now hierarchical.
A system thus allows you to adapt your old locations has this new architecture. 
For that, two parameters are presented to you in bottom of the page: 
1 - character of separation which you perhaps used to define your internal hierarchy 
2 - the definition of a ROTT place if you want it 

Once these selected options a table presented the new generated hierarchy to you. 
If it is appropriate to you, you can validate in lower part of the table. 
If not, you can change your parameters and regenerate a hierarchy while clicking on the first << Validate >> 

10 ) 
All these configurations are only accessible by a new type of user: the « super-admin ».
The update automaticaly convert the « admin » user to « super-admin ».


Then, several cases are possible depending of your previous version


CASE 1: You had « admin » users or at least 1 « admin » user  was not connected to the application 
from external sources (ldap, IMAP) (in this case the password is not stored in the data base). 

All the « admin » users having a non-empty password become « super-admin ». You must to see a message.

Your database is up to date. You can now configure GLPI using the « use GLPI » button. Then, login as an old admin user.



CAS 2: You do not have « admin » user or all your admins have an empty password (because they login 
using an external source).

Then, you must to create a new « super-admin » user (do not enter a name already used by an other user)

If this step succeed, your database is up to date and you can use GLPI using the « use GLPI » button.
Then, login as the new  « super-admin » user you create.

When you finish to configure GLPI, you can delete this user.
Please, keep attention on the fact that you must always have a « super-admin » user 
in order to connect to GLPI when the external authentification sources are down.

#### VERSION > 0.5
Copy the backup of the docs directory in the empty dir of your new installation.

*************************************************************************************************************
--- FRESH INSTALLATION
*************************************************************************************************************

The installation of GLPI is quite easy. Since the v0.4, there is no more file you should edit by hand.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Get the tarball of GLPI on our server. Unpack it on your computer. 
You obtain a directory called glpi containing the whole files of GLPI.

2. Copy this directory onto your server.

3. Using your browser, get the root of GLPI. You can now configure GLPI using an graphic interface.
After this step, you can use GLPI and begin to work.

Install the whole files of GLPI in your web space, where you want that GLPI is accessible to the public.

Now, it is necessary to modify permissions to some directories in order that PHP can write in:
/files and /config

If something is wrong, you cannot continur the installtion. An error message will appear that explain you 
what to do to correct the problem.

If all is ok, you can click on « continue ».

--- Installation steps

Step 1 : Configuration of the access to the database server.

You must enter in a form all the informations needed to connect to MySQL.

« Mysql server » is the hostname where is your database server. For example: localhost or mysql.domain.tld

« Mysql user » is the username you use to connect to the server.

« Mysql pass » is the password of the username
This field can be empty if your user have no password (No comment will be done here on the security

your parameters and retry.

Step 2 : Choose or create the database.

The access to the database is ok. You mustr to create or choose the database that GLPI will use.

Two possibilities:

-  You want to use an existing database to store the GLPI tables:

Select this database and click on continue to initialize this database.

-  You want to create a new database to store the GLPI tables:

For this case, you must to have the rights to create a new database on the server.

Select « create a new database ». Enter the name of the database that you want to create in the text field.

Step 4 : This stage indicates that the installation of GLPI is now finished, a summary is displayed.
Read these informations attentively and click on "use GLPI" to perform your first connection 
with the application. 

--- End of the installation

In case of error (of the kind: you forgot your own access to GLPI...), to start again this procedure of 
installation, it is necessary to use your software ftp (for example) and to erase the following file: 
-  config/config_db.php

For security reasons you must to set the read right to config/config_db.php only to the  web service user.
Example : chmod 400 config/config_db.php

Use your browser to get the root of GLPI: http://yourserver/glpi/ (by default) to start again 
the procedure of configuration then (actually, it is the absence of file "config_db.php" which causes 
the launching of this procedure).
